<p style='text-align: justify;'> 
Cutting edge embedded systems have always been a part of NIMEâ€™s practices. Low-resource computing hardware, such as microcontrollers or single-board computers, 
can be embedded into digital musical instruments or interfaces to perform specific functions such as real-time digital signal processing of sensor data and sound. 
Simultaneously, an interest in exploiting the creative potentials of Artificial Intelligence for instrument design and musical expression has been growing within 
the NIME community in the past years.

<p style='text-align: justify;'> 
Recent advancements in embedded computing have allowed for faster and more intensive computation capabilities. 
However, the deployment of machine learning or symbolic AI techniques still presents several technical challenges 
(e.g., data bandwidth, memory handling) and higher-level design constraints. 
Some of these challenges are general to embedded systems, while others are specific to musical interaction, 
particularly questions regarding real-time performance and latency.

With this workshop we aim to:

1. Bring together a body of research practitioners that face such challenges in the context of NIME.
1. Articulate these challenges and identify the tools and technologies being currently used to overcome them.
1. Forge a community using embedded AI for NIME.
1. Discuss critical approaches on the use of embedded AI for musical expression.
