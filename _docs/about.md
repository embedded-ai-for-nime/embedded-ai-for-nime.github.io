<p style='text-align: justify;'> 
The re-purposing of cutting edge embedded systems has always been a part of NIMEâ€™s identity and this history is reflected 
in the nascent explorations of implementing machine learning, a-life and adaptive systems on constrained environments. 
The recent advancements in embedded computing have allowed for faster and more intensive computation capabilities, 
however the implementation of systems relating to musical expression still presents several technical challenges (e.g., bandwidth, latency, memory)
as well as higher level design constraints, both related to deploying systems in environments with limited computational resources.

With this workshop we aim to:

1. Bring together a body of research practitioners that face such challenges in the context of NIME.
1. Articulate these challenges and identify the tools and technologies being currently used to overcome them.
1. Forge a community using embedded AI for musical expression.
