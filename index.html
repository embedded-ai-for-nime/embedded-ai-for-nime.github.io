    <h3 class="header-light regular-pad">Welcome</h2>
      <p>
      With this workshop we aim to bring together researchers with the common interest of working with and developing embedded AI for NIME,
      and to jointly identify the challenges, trends, and technologies in use.
      </p>

      <p>
      The workshop will have a duration of a half-day split in two cycles accommodate different time zones.
      </p>
      <ul>
      <li>The first half-hour of each cycle will start with 5-minute presentations from each of the organiser labs and 15-minute opening talks by Prof Rebecca Fiebrink and Dr Jack Armitage.</li>
      <li>The rest of the cycle will consist of 10 minute presentations, grouped in sessions by topic, each followed by an open discussion with presenters and atendees. We will use collaborative boards (padlets) to share the discussion content among discussions and time zone cycles. The last 10 minutes will serve as a wrap-up.</li>
      </ul>

      <li>Design strategies and conceptual frameworks for embedded AI </li>
      
      <li>Interaction paradigms for systems using embedded AI</li>
      
      <li>Embedded and real-time neural audio synthesis methods (e.g., neural, artificial life, statistical methods etc.)</li>

      <li>AR/MR/VR systems using AI in the context of NIME</li>
      
      <li>Mobile computing systems using AI in the context of NIME</li>
      
      <li>Musical uses of AI in embedded platforms</li>

      <li>Workflows for moving AI implementations between laptop, embedded/real-time and HPC platforms</li>
      
      <li>Development environments for interactive machine learning in embedded contexts, particularly those targeting non-expert users</li>
      
      <li>Values, biases, ethical and philosophical issues with embedding AI in musical performance</li>
