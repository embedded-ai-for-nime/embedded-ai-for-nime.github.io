    <h3 class="header-light regular-pad">Welcome</h2>
      <p>
      With this workshop we aim to bring together researchers with the common interest of working with and developing embedded AI for NIME,
      and to jointly identify the challenges, trends, and technologies in use.
      Furthermore, we expect it to serve as the starting point for an embedded AI NIME community and as future reference to help newcomers get started with embedded AI.
      </p>

      <p>
      The workshop will have a duration of a half-day split in two cycles. We will try to accommodate to the presenters, arranging the sessions in a way so that we can cover a few timezones.
      </p>
      <ul>
      <li>The first half-hour of each cycle will start with 15-minute opening talks by Prof Rebecca Fiebrink and Dr Jack Armitage.</li>
      <li>The rest of the cycle will consist of brief talks or demos grouped in sessions by topic. After each session, we will have an open discussion with presenters and attendees moderated by the student organisers. We will use collaborative boards (padlets) to share the discussion content among sessions. The last 10 minutes will serve as a wrap-up.</li>
      </ul>

      We are welcoming proposal submissions in the form of extended abstracts, explaining the content of the proposed talk and its relevance for the workshop. Successful submissionsâ€™ abstracts will be published in online proceedings. The proposal can be for a demo, a poster presentation, a progress report, a short paper presentation... anything of relevance to the topic of Embedded AI for NIME that fits in 10 minutes.
      <br><br>Topics include, but are not limited to:
      
      <ul>
      <li>Any technical prototype or concrete implementation of resource-constrained systems using AI in the context of NIME</li>
      
      <li>Design strategies and conceptual frameworks for embedded AI </li>
      
      <li>Interaction paradigms for systems using embedded AI</li>
      
      <li>Embedded and real-time neural audio synthesis methods (e.g., neural, artificial life, statistical methods etc.)</li>

      <li>AR/MR/VR systems using AI in the context of NIME</li>
      
      <li>Mobile computing systems using AI in the context of NIME</li>
      
      <li>Musical uses of AI in embedded platforms</li>

      <li>Workflows for moving AI implementations between laptop, embedded/real-time and HPC platforms</li>
      
      <li>Development environments for interactive machine learning in embedded contexts, particularly those targeting non-expert users</li>
      
      <li>Values, biases, ethical and philosophical issues with embedded AI in musical performance</li>
      
      <li>Inclusivity and diversity in emerging embedded AI communities</li>
      </ul>
      <b>The proposal should have an extension of 3/4 to 1 page.</b>
