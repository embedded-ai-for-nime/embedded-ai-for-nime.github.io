    <h2 class="header-light regular-pad">Welcome</h2>
      <p>
      With this workshop we aim to bring together researchers with the common interest of working with and developing embedded AI for NIMEs,
      and to jointly identify the challenges, trends, and technologies in use.
      </p>
      <p>
      SHORT OVERVIEW OF THE PROGRAMME : TALKS / PRESENTATIONS / DISCUSSIONS
      </p>
      <p>
      The workshop will run for half a day and will be repeated for different time-zones. <br>
      We aim to group the selected presenters under similar topics, however these topics are not proposed in advance in hope that those will emerge by themselves in the submissions.
